# Synthetic-Employee-Attrition
This project presents an end-to-end Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The objective is to analyze workforce attrition patterns and identify key drivers influencing employee turnover across demographic, work-related, and satisfaction-based factors.
The analysis uses a synthetic employee dataset to simulate real-world HR analytics scenarios and demonstrate practical data analysis, modeling, and visualization skills relevant to HR and People Analytics roles.

# Objective
The goal of this project is to analyze employee attrition patterns and answer key business questions such as:

Which employee segments experience the highest attrition?

How do work arrangements and work–life balance affect retention?

What role do commuting distance, age, marital status, and education play in turnover?

# Dataset

The dataset is a synthetic employee attrition dataset containing information on:

Employee demographics (Age, Marital Status, Education)

Work arrangement (Remote vs On-site)

Work–life balance and job satisfaction

Commuting distance

Attrition status
