# Synthetic-Employee-Attrition
This project presents an end-to-end Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The objective is to analyze workforce attrition patterns and identify key drivers influencing employee turnover across demographic, work-related, and satisfaction-based factors.
The analysis uses a synthetic employee dataset to simulate real-world HR analytics scenarios and demonstrate practical data analysis, modeling, and visualization skills relevant to HR and People Analytics roles.

# Business Problem
Employee attrition leads to increased recruitment costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and reduced organizational productivity. HR teams require actionable insights to understand who is leaving, why they are leaving, and what actions can reduce turnover.

This dashboard addresses the following business questions:
How does work arrangement (remote vs on-site) affect attrition?
Which age groups and marital statuses experience the highest turnover?
How do work–life balance and commuting distance influence attrition?
Does education level impact employee retention?

# Dataset
The dataset is a synthetic employee attrition dataset containing information on:

Employee demographics (Age, Marital Status, Education)

Work arrangement (Remote vs On-site)

Work–life balance and job satisfaction

Commuting distance

Attrition status
