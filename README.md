The project demonstrates practical HR analytics, data modeling, DAX, and data storytelling skills applicable to Data Analyst and People Analytics roles.

#Objective

Which employee segments experience the highest attrition?

How do work arrangements and work–life balance affect retention?

What role do commuting distance, age, marital status, and education play in turnover?
