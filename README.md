# Synthetic-Employee-Attrition
This project presents an end-to-end Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The objective is to analyze workforce attrition patterns and identify key drivers influencing employee turnover across demographic, work-related, and satisfaction-based factors.
The analysis uses a synthetic employee dataset to simulate real-world HR analytics scenarios and demonstrate practical data analysis, modeling, and visualization skills relevant to HR and People Analytics roles.

# Business Problem
Employee attrition leads to increased recruitment costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and reduced organizational productivity. HR teams require actionable insights to understand who is leaving, why they are leaving, and what actions can reduce turnover.

### This Project addresses the following business questions:

How does work arrangement (remote vs on-site) affect attrition?

Which age groups and marital statuses experience the highest turnover?

How do work–life balance and commuting distance influence attrition?

Does education level impact employee retention?

# Data Source

Excel / CSV – Source data format

# Preparation Tools

Power BI – Data modeling, DAX measures, and interactive dashboards

Power Query – Data cleaning and transformation

DAX – Attrition rate calculations, segmentation, and KPIs

Total Employees: A distinct count of the employee population to establish a denominator for all ratio calculations.

Attrition Count: A filtered measure that aggregates the total number of staff exits.

Attrition Rate: The mathematical ratio of exits to total headcount, providing a standardized view of workforce stability.

Avg Monthly Income: An arithmetic mean of the monthly income column used to track compensation trends.

### Remote Work vs Attrition
<img width="377" height="281" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-17 120841" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/be3dad0f-13ea-40d1-b2cb-5b8f818af543" />

This analysis compares attrition outcomes between employees working remotely and those working on-site across different job levels

Insight:
Employees with remote work arrangements exhibit lower attrition and higher job satisfaction, while on-site employees demonstrate significantly higher turnover. This highlights workplace flexibility as a key determinant of employee retention.

### How Does Work–Life Balance Affect Attrition Rate?
<img width="396" height="281" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-17 114048" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/efcca57c-5a57-4265-b930-a488b84f14c2" />

This Chart shows the work-life balance rating:

Poor: 30.99%

Good: 20.91%

Fair: 29.63%

Exellent: 18.47%

Insight:
Employees reporting poor work–life balance exhibit significantly higher attrition, indicating the impact of excessive workloads, limited scheduling flexibility, and insufficient monitoring of employee burnout.

### How Does Education Level Affect Attrition?

Insight:
Employees holding Bachelor’s degrees experience higher attrition compared to those with postgraduate qualifications, likely due to greater external job opportunities and lower barriers to job mobility.

### Age Group vs Attrition
<img width="382" height="274" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-17 114658" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9ff755b0-bc25-4382-9924-6f5656837fe1" />

Attrition distribution across age groups is as follows:

Under 25: 9.8k

25–34: 14.1k

35–44: 14.4k

45–54: 14.2k

55+: 7.1k

Insight:
The highest attrition occurs among employees aged 35-44, reflecting a period of heightened career mobility. 
Contributing factors likely include pursuit of accelerated career progression, competitive compensation expectations, and increased willingness to change roles or locations.

### Distance to Work vs Attrition
<img width="396" height="277" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-19 085456" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e53eff05-2304-4a50-a9de-89332408aba3" />

Attrition count by commuting distance:

0–5 km: 3k

6–10 km: 3k

11–20 km: 6k

21–30 km: 6k

31+ km: 42k

Insight:
Attrition increases substantially as commuting distance grows. Extended travel times contribute to employee fatigue and reduced engagement, making commuting strain a critical factor in turnover.

### Marital Status vs Attrition
<img width="368" height="281" alt="Screenshot 2026-01-17 114952" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ae35327-2010-462f-95b1-1d9a05a0b931" />

Attrition rates by marital status:

Single: 46.51%

Divorced: 28.33%

Married: 25.16%

Insight:
Married employees account for the highest proportion of attrition. This trend may be influenced by family-related responsibilities, the need for flexible working conditions, and evolving career priorities.
