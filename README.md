# Synthetic-Employee-Attrition
This project presents an end-to-end Employee Attrition Analysis Dashboard built using Power BI. The objective is to analyze workforce attrition patterns and identify key drivers influencing employee turnover across demographic, work-related, and satisfaction-based factors.
The analysis uses a synthetic employee dataset to simulate real-world HR analytics scenarios and demonstrate practical data analysis, modeling, and visualization skills relevant to HR and People Analytics roles.

# Business Problem
Employee attrition leads to increased recruitment costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and reduced organizational productivity. HR teams require actionable insights to understand who is leaving, why they are leaving, and what actions can reduce turnover.

This Project addresses the following business questions:

How does work arrangement (remote vs on-site) affect attrition?

Which age groups and marital statuses experience the highest turnover?

How do work–life balance and commuting distance influence attrition?

Does education level impact employee retention?

Insight:
Employees with remote work arrangements exhibit lower attrition and higher job satisfaction, while on-site employees demonstrate significantly higher turnover. This highlights workplace flexibility as a key determinant of employee retention.
